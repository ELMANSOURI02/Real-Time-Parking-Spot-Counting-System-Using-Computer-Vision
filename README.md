# Real-Time-Parking-Spot-Counting-System-Using-Computer-Vision
Project Overview
This project involves developing a real-time parking spot detection and counting system using computer vision techniques. By utilizing image processing techniques such as binary thresholding and dilation, the system can identify and count the available parking spaces in a live video feed.

The main goal of this project is to demonstrate how image processing and computer vision can be applied to monitor parking availability, providing an efficient solution for real-time monitoring.

Features
Real-time detection of available parking spaces using video feed
Utilization of binary thresholding, Gaussian blur, and dilation for enhanced image processing
Displays the count of free parking spaces on the video output

Technologies and Tools Used
Programming Language: Python 3.x
Libraries: OpenCV, Numpy, CvZone
Data Storage: Pickle for saving parking spot position
